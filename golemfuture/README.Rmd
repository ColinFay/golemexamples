# golemfuture

This application demoes how to use `{future}` and `{promises}` for asynchronous programming in `{shiny}`. 

See `app_server.R` for a detail of the settings. 

Note that for better perfs and for more customization, the `future::plan(future::multisession)` should either be set inside the `app.R` (for RStudio products deployment), or before the `run_app()` call when building a Docker image. 
In other words, I wouldn't advice to set the `future::plan` inside the server function.
